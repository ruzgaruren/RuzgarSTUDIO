## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
library(readr)

dagitilan_miktar <- read_csv("C:/Users/winds/Desktop/scfinalwork/dagitilan mama miktari verisi.csv")
View(dagitilan_miktar)



pandemide_dagitilan_miktar <- read_csv("C:/Users/winds/Desktop/scfinalwork/pandemi-surecinde-sokak-hayvanlarina-dagitilan-mama-miktari.csv")
View(pandemide_dagitilan_miktar)


# Assign more meaningful variable names

colnames(dagitilan_miktar)<-c("animal_id","year","month","district","town","location","quantity","unit")
ls()
View(dagitilan_miktar)

mean(dagitilan_miktar$quantity)
colnames(pandemide_dagitilan_miktar)<-c("animal_id","year","month","district","town","location","quantity","unit")
ls()
View(dagitilan_miktar)
mean(pandemide_dagitilan_miktar$quantity)











```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)

# correlation between month and quantity
with(pandemide_dagitilan_miktar, cor(month, quantity))








```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
qplot(month, quantity, data = pandemide_dagitilan_miktar)

# Scatter plot of outcome (month) against quantity
qplot(month, quantity,  data = pandemide_dagitilan_miktar)

qplot(quantity, month, geom = "boxplot", data = pandemide_dagitilan_miktar)






```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
