## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

summary(cars)
mesh<- read_csv("C:/Users/winds/Desktop/G/1- CENG 3516 Statistical Computing 2020-2021 Bahar/çalýþma/sokakhayvanlarý/Muayene Edilen Sokak Hayvanlarý Verisi.csv")

dmm<-read.table("C:/Users/winds/Desktop/G/1- CENG 3516 Statistical Computing 2020-2021 Bahar/çalisma/sokakhayvanlari/Dagitilan Mama Miktari.csv")

View(dmm)






```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
